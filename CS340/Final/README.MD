A simple PHP and MySQL driven website. Will add more details as I get further along in the project.  Uses bootstrap for the formatting: http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/javascript.html#transitions 

1. Add the 'dbsetup.sql' to your desired SQL Server.
2. Update 'connection-mysql.php' with your credentials.
3. Add/Edit and have fun.
