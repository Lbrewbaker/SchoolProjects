A simple PHP and MySQL driven website. Will add more details as I get further along in the project.  Uses bootstrap for the styling: http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/javascript.html#transitions 

1. Add the 'dbsetup.sql' queries to your desired SQL Server. May have to edit depending on which version you're running.
2. Update 'connection-mysql.php' with your server credentials.
3. Add/Edit into the databases as necessary
4. Have fun.
